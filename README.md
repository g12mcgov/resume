======

This is my resume, in LaTex!

I got bored and decided it would be cool to convert my resume to LaTex. I found the original template online (cited in the header comment), but significantly modified it to suit my needs. 

How-to
======

If you're going to download it and use it, you must compile with LuaLaTex. This is because it uses the "fontawesome" package for the social media icons at the top of the page. 

Remarks 
======

By no means am I a LaTex expert. It's certainly an interesting language that perhaps I'll really take the time to learn some day.
